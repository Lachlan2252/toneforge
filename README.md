# ToneForge

ToneForge is an AI-powered guitar tone recreator that captures the sound of
iconic recordings and rebuilds them for any guitarist. This repository hosts the
initial skeleton for the application, including a Flutter frontend, a C++ audio
engine, and a Python backend placeholder.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` – Flutter application
- `audio_engine/` – C++ digital signal processing core
- `backend/` – Python backend and unit tests

Each subdirectory contains its own README with additional details.

## Getting Started

1. Explore the subdirectories to see the current scaffolding.
2. Run tests with `pytest`:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

More features and documentation will be added as the project evolves.
